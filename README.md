# DecisionTree-NaiveBayes-SVM-ANN
A small implementation of decisiontree, naive bayes, svm and ann with a certain dataset

Model Construction: Classification

a) Do the data preprocessing steps, if required.

b) Training & Test
  i) Decide how you will partition your data into training and test sets.
  ii) Use holdout method for each of your classifiers separately.
  iii) In addition to holdout method, use cross-validation for at least one of your classifiers.
  iv) In addition to above, implement bagging ensemble method for your classifiers.
  v) In addition to above, implement boosting ensemble method for your classifiers
  
c) Make the required type node settings.

d) Use your dataset to construct 6 classification models as follows:
  i) Decision tree using gain ratio.
  ii) Decision tree using gini index.
  iii) Na√Øve Bayes.
  iv) Artificial neural networks with 1 hidden layer.
  v) Artificial neural networks with 2 hidden layers.
  vi) Support vector machines.
