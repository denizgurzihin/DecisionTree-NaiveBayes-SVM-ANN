# DecisionTree-NaiveBayes-SVM-ANN
A small implementation of decisiontree, naive bayes, svm and ann with a certain dataset

Model Construction: Classification

a) Do the data preprocessing steps, if required.<br/>

b) Training & Test<br/>
  $~~~$i) Decide how you will partition your data into training and test sets.<br/>
  $~~~$ii) Use holdout method for each of your classifiers separately.<br/>
  $~~~$iii) In addition to holdout method, use cross-validation for at least one of your classifiers.<br/>
  $~~~$iv) In addition to above, implement bagging ensemble method for your classifiers.<br/>
  $~~~$v) In addition to above, implement boosting ensemble method for your classifiers<br/>
  
c) Make the required type node settings.

d) Use your dataset to construct 6 classification models as follows:<br/>
  $~~~$i) Decision tree using gain ratio.<br/>
  $~~~$ii) Decision tree using gini index.<br/>
  $~~~$iii) Na√Øve Bayes.<br/>
  $~~~$iv) Artificial neural networks with 1 hidden layer.<br/>
  $~~~$v) Artificial neural networks with 2 hidden layers.<br/>
  $~~~$vi) Support vector machines.<br/>
